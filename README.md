Tokaido is a Drupal environment launcher that _just works_. 

It creates Drupal environments in seconds and requires no manual configuration 
for your Drupal site to work out-of-the-box.

## Why switch to Tokaido?

Tokaido was built out of frustration with how much time Drupal developers spend
trying to manage their local development environments. While other great tools
like DrupalVM and Lando have made it easier and easier for developers to build
repeatable Drupal environments, we felt there was still a lot of room for 
improvement. 

With Tokaido, we have shifted towards a more opinionated Drupal environment 
setup and coupled it with the same containers that we (Ironstar) run in 
enterprise Drupal hosting environments. 

So what makes Tokaido faster and more efficient?

- Using Docker instead of Vagrant enables faster, more light-weight environments
- We use Unison to sync files between your system and the Tokaido environment, so there's no performance hit from slow virtual disks
- The powerful `tok` CLI streamlines your set up and helps keep you out of config files
- Tokaido's inbuilt proxy enables verified SSL connections to your environment: https://local.tokaido.io:5154
- Built-in Varnish caching enables production-like testing of your code

\* Docker4Drupal is controlled by a Docker Compose file and requires an indepth
understanding of Docker and Docker Compose in order to make changes. 

\+ Lando provides a helpful CLI that makes starting and managing environments
easier, but we still think Tokaido has it beat in this department. 

\+\+ Lando's 'ssh' environment is really just a docker-compose exec command, 
which is helpful for running commands but is not a full-featured dev environment

\*\* Nearly every Drupal project we've tested works with Tokaido without any 
special config. When testing Lando and Docker4Drupal, even the most basic Drupal
minimal installation required special config to get going. 

What about DrupalVM, DDev, and other tools? In the case of VM-based Drupal
environments, we feel these are all too slow for modern web development, with
some tools taking over 30 minutes to launch test environments. 

## What can't Tokaido do yet?

With Tokaido, we've tried to make it easy to get up and going with most Drupal
projects, but there are still some cases where Tokaido is improving:

- Multisite and Domain Access sites. These will work, but you'll need to manually set up your database. For domains, anything at *.local.tokaido.io will resolve to your local host. 
- PHP 5.6 and 7.2. Right now, Tokaido works with PHP 7.1 only. We have no plans to add support for PHP 5.6, but 7.2 support is coming soon.
- Xdebug works but is experimental. Please help us test it !
