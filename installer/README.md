# ðŸš… Tokaido Self-Installer

Tokaido is an automation platform for Drupal development environments on MacOS.

This installer is generally to be loaded onto a USB device or similar to facilitate an easy and fast install/copy of Tokaido, composer cache and Docker images. Everything you need to get started with a new Tokaido environment.

At this stage internet connectivity is still required in order to download a few smaller files, however we are planning to make this installer fully offline in a future release.

## Installation

In this directory, there should be three files corresponding to you OS type

- `tok-osx`: Apple MacOS El Capitan and above
- `tok-linux-amd64`: Linux distributions. Tested to this point in time with Ubuntu and Mint
- `tok-windows-amd64`: Windows 10

Executing the file that corresponds to your OS should open your default terminal and run the self-installer.

## Next Steps

You're now ready to go with Tokaido. Run `tok new` and start a new Drupal project!
