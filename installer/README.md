# ðŸš… Tokaido Self-Installer

Tokaido is an automation platform for Drupal development environments on MacOS, Linux, and Windows

This installer is generally to be loaded onto a USB device or similar to facilitate an easy and fast install of Tokaido, composer cache and Docker images. Everything you need to get started with a new Tokaido environment!

At this stage internet connectivity is still required in order to download a few smaller files, however we are planning to make this installer fully offline in a future release.

## Requirements

Before you can use Tokaido, you need to have Docker installed on your systme.

### For MacOS

For MacOS, you need to install "Docker for Mac", which is in the included `Docker.dmg` file. 

### For Windows

Docker on Windows requires Windows Pro edition. Sorry, but Windows Home edition is not supported. 

- Install Docker Desktop by running the `Docker Desktop Installer.exe` included in this USB
- Install the Git Bash console by running `git-bash.exe`

## Installing Tokaido

In this directory, there should be three files corresponding to your OS type. 

- `tok-installer-macos`: Apple MacOS El Capitan and above
- `tok-installer-linux-amd64`: Linux distributions. Tested to this point in time with Ubuntu and Mint
- `tok-installer-windows-amd64`: Windows 10

After installing Docker, Executing the file that corresponds to your OS should open your default terminal and run the self-installer.

## Next Steps

You're now ready to go with Tokaido. Run `tok new` and start a new Drupal project!
